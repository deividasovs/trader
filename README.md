# Trading script
Playing around with trading strategies and seeing if a custom made trading bot could show any possible returns.
Code not the cleanest, just rushing it out for fun :)

## APIs used
- Alpaca 
- Yahoo Finance 

## Tech stack

## To try out 
1. Every hour, try get earnings report of x companies, if good buy and hold for x days (weeks) (HIGH)
2. Better to only make trade during stock market open hours?
2. Get latest articles. If sentiment on them is good, then buy. Else sell 
3. See the type of strategies chatGPT comes up with

Use news and twitter? If news articles are out and there's been an uptick in tweets abt company, if the news sentiment was good then buy. Else not
Could we just use Yahoo finance recommendation strategy for buying and holding stock?
Check it every day or something?

## TODO:
- Make orders into limit ones, only buy if x% higher than market price
